       <h1 style=color:brown>Tips:</h1> 
    <h3>
        Similarly there are lots of free resources out there on the internet for free to prepare for your crucial time!!! Self-introduction is very important. Before starting the interview, the interviewer asks the candidate for self-introduction. This is the best opportunity for a candidate to tell why the interviewer should hire you rather than the rest of the candidates appearing for the interview. The self-introduction should be short and crisp. The candidate can talk about the skill set he/she possesses, explaining about the internships, certifications done, and can also give a brief about the projects done. One can mention the achievements and active participation and organizing events held in college, which shows the quality of leadership and team management.

        <br><br>Before appearing for the HR Interview, it is advised to know about the company, research about the technologies the company uses and some projects it has worked on, few of their clients, so that when the interviewer asks the questions such as what do you know about the company, answering this question mentioning all the above-mentioned details will impress the interviewer how much you are interested in the company. Also, the communication skills of the candidate will be assessed in this round. Some behavioral questions might also be asked to know an individual’s attitude and to check if he/she fits the company’s culture or not. So one should think and answer all these questions with the utmost attention.
        
        <br><br>So, to finalize initially, there will be a skill-based test comprising of MCQs from technical subjects, aptitude, coding. The next levels of screening include group discussions, versant, technical and HR interviews. Also, the number of technical interviews and their duration varies according to the company.
